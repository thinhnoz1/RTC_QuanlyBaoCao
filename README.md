This project is created base on the idea of what Trello did. It's for managing your work and task
This is my first big project, all of the work from designing database, coding, creating user interfaces
i did by myself in about 2 weeks

Although it's still not finished, it is still have a lot of work to do so I will try my best to update it.
Currently right now, the performance of the website is still pretty bad imo but it's my first project and I can guarantee you it's bug free.
Especially the "Trello-like" main module. 

I have include Database file in the github!
Have fun ^^!
